### Changes since last deliverable:

This is the 1st deliverable

### Description:

A text-based playable version of the classic Monopoly game, forming the Model part of the MVC pattern.

### Known issues:

None

### Roadmap ahead:

Implementing a GUI-based version (now you’re adding the View and the Controller!) of the  game. Update UML  and data structures corresponding to the source code and provide unit tests. Improve code based on the TA's feedback.

### Decisions Made:

-We decided to add 23 squares in the board instead of the classic game's 40 since we are not allowed to use all the utilities and houses yet.

-Properties are color coded and the taxes vary depending on the color. However owning all the same colored properties will not have any advantages for the player

-Once the player is unable to pay rent, he is eliminated since we have decided not to include the concept of mortages

### User Manuel:

-  Double click the jar file and select the number of players

- Type in "roll" to roll the dice and start the game

- Type in "help" for further instructions
